# üé¨Movie Review System
Movie Review System is based on the Natural Processing Language or NLP Model
that takes the review from the user and predict the review as a `positive` or `negative`.
Model is train using the TensorFlow and TensorFlow API called Keras. This application predict 
the output with the accuracy level i.e. how much confident the model is on that particular prediction.

## What you get at the end?

If you successfully complete all the steps than you get an application which looks something like this.

## Let's get started ü§ù
Okay!! I'm in. What I need to get this application running on my own browser?

`You need to follow these 5 simple steps to get this application.`

### Step1: Clone this repository in your own system
```
$ git clone https://www.github.com/abhishekv5055/movie-review-system.git
```

### Step2: Install the pipenv enviornment
Lets install the virtual environment so that we cannot mess up with the configuration of our own system.

> Note: Before moving forward make sure you must have a python==3.5+ installed in your system.

```
$ pip install pipenv
```

### Step3: Lets install the required modules
```
$ cd app \
  && pipenv install
```
This will download all the modules that are required for this application in the virtual enviornment.

### Step4: Activate the Enviornment
```
$ cd app \ 
  && pipenv shell
```
This will activate the environment. Now you can access all your modules that you had downloaded in the above step.

### Step5: Run the application
```
$ cd app \
  && streamlit run app.py
```
This will open up the new tab of your default browser and launch the application on the localhost:8501.

Congratulations!!! üéâ You have successfully run your Machine Learning Application in the easy 5 Steps. Now you can deploy it in any free cloud service provider like, Heroku, Netlify, etc.
